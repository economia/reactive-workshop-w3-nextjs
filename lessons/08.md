## Actual components

For now, we have the file structure we're going to need in the end. However, the contents
of all the pages are empty! Let's change that by copying code from the original React app
to our newly defined page files.

Since we're using Bootstrap in order to make our app look good, we first need to install the required dependencies:

`npm install --save reactstrap [@types/reactstrap]`

*Note: only install `@types/reactstrap` if you're using TypeScript*

Now we can copy contents of all original components to their respective page files.

For now, you don't have to bother with making events and data fetching work, we'll tackle that later.
Basically just copy the JSX. 

Since we will be providing all the necessary data from props, you can 
remove all context consumers from these files, only keep the actual rendering logic.

**Files you should copy:**
* `src/components/Article/List.tsx` - to `pages/index.tsx`
* `src/components/Article/Create.tsx` - to `pages/article/create.tsx`
* `src/components/Article/index.tsx` - to `pages/article/[id].tsx`

In case of the Article detail page, you can remove the `<ButtonGroup>` in the header,
since we won't be implementing the edit and delete functionality now.

Also, don't forget to copy the `constants` and `types` folders from the original app and use them
in the new page files.
