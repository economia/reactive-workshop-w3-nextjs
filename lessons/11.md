## Where do we get some data?

Using API routes we learned about in lesson 4, we will now define our data model.
 
Just a quick recap: these are the files located in the `pages/api` directory.

Replicate the following file structure: 
```
├── pages
│   └── api
│       └── articles
│           ├── [id].ts
│           └── index.ts
```

For now, we can stub these files with example responses, just like in lesson 4: 

```typescript
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'

export default (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  res.status(200).json({ title: 'Next.js' })
}
```
