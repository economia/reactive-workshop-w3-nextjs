## Reusing components

Most of the time, you don't write completely new code for each page in your application, 
you might want to reuse some components of it in more than one place. 

That's what the `components` directory is for! 

Thanks to Next.js's automatic code splitting, every component you include in one or more of your pages 
will be fetched from a separate file in the browser, saving you precious time and data during the first page load.
The main application bundle only contains chunks of code which are used in at least 50% of your application, 
all other parts are split into separate files which get loaded auto-magically when needed.

Let's create a dummy component which we can use in both our pages: 

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react'

export const ArticleTitle = ({ children }) => (
  <h1>{ children }</h1>
)
```

Since we're creating a component, not a page, it doesn't matter how we export our component - 
we can use either named export or default export.

Then, we import this file in our pages and use it to render the text in them: 

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react'
import { ArticleTitle } from '../components'

const Articles = () => (
  <ArticleTitle>Hello there!</ArticleTitle>
)

export default Articles
```

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
import { ArticleTitle } from '../components'

const Article = () => {
  const {
    query: {
      id
    } 
  } = useRouter()

  return (
    <ArticleTitle>Showing article with ID { id }.</ArticleTitle>
  )
}

export default Article
```
