## Programmatic routing

After doing some actions in your app (like sending a form), you might want to change the location
of your app afterwards. That's where the `next/router` package comes in handy - it allows you to 
change the location of your application right from the code.

How to change the route: 
```typescript
import Router from 'next/router'

Router.push('/')
```
