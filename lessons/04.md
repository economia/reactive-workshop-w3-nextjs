## API routes

Next.js isn't only capable of serving React components as pages - we can also use it to create API routes,
which return some data (usually in JSON) instead of HTML.

This is particularly useful if you need to create some API logic which you need in your app, 
and you can do this with a few simple steps - no need to configure a HTTP server or anything.

Any file in the directory `pages/api` will automatically get mapped to a route `/api/...`.

```
└── pages
    └── api
        └── listArticles.ts
```

Here is an example file (let's call it `listArticles.ts`) with a simple response: 

```typescript
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'

export default (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  res.status(200).json({ title: 'Next.js' })
}
```

Now, if you call the route `/api/listArticles`, you will see a JSON response we defined above.
