## Getting data on both server and client

Since in SSR, your app gets rendered both on the server and in the browser, 
you need to provide your data to the page in an easy way. 
Luckily, Next.js is able to perform network requests on server-side too, thus making it easy to get data into your pages.

To have one point where you fetch your data both on server and in the browser, 
you only need one **static** method in your page: `getInitialProps`.

This method gets called before even creating the React component, 
so that the data are available to it as props from the moment it is created.

```typescript
import React from 'react'
import fetch from 'isomorphic-unfetch'

const Page = class extends React.PureComponent<any> {
  static async getInitialProps () {
    const result = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/listArticles') // Remember, SSR requires an absolute URL 
    const data = await result.json()

    return {
      data
    }
  }

  render () {
    const {
      data
    } = this.props

    return (
      <div>
        { JSON.stringify(data) }
      </div>
    )  
  }
}

export default Page

--- or --- 

const Page = () => {
  const {
    data
  } = this.props

  return (
    <div>
      { JSON.stringify(data) }
    </div>
  )
}

Page.getInitialProps = async () => {
  const result = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/listArticles') 
  const data = await result.json()

  return {
    data
  } 
}

export default Page
```

Don't forget to install the `isomorphic-unfetch` package:

```
npm install --save isomorphic-unfetch
```

Now, your app has data to use since the initial load!
