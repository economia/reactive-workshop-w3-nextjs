## Where's the Bootstrap though?!

As you might've noticed when viewing the app, even though we added the `reactstrap` package
to our app, we are still missing the actual Bootstrap styles. This is because `reactstrap`
only provides wrappers for the actual Bootstrap components, which only assign the required
CSS classes. 

In order to actually see our site with Bootstrap styles, we need to add the Bootstrap CSS
stylesheet into our application. We can do this very easily with Next.js!

In order to load the CSS file on every page in our app, we need to create a file
called `_app.tsx` in the `pages` directory. This is the default wrapper component which
will be used to render every page in our application. You can override default Next.js logic
if you ever have a need for that, for now, we will only extend the default layout of our app with some stuff.

To save some time, here's a working `_app.tsx` file you can use: 

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Container } from 'reactstrap'
import App from 'next/app'
import Head from 'next/head'
import { Navigation } from '../components/Navigation'
import 'bootstrap-css-only/css/bootstrap.min.css'

class Workshop extends App {
  render () {
    const {
      props: {
        Component,
        pageProps
      }
    } = this

    return (
      <>
        <Head> {/* The Head component (available from the next/head package) handles changing the head element on every page - you can use this in any page file*/}
          <title>Next.js Workshop</title> {/* This is the title that will be used for every page */}
          {/* meta tags would go here */}
        </Head>
        <Container fluid style={{ padding: 0 }}> {/* Default Bootstrap wrapper to make our app look good */}
          <Navigation/>
          <Component {...pageProps}/> {/* The actual page that is being rendered, along with any props it should receive */}
        </Container>
      </>
    )
  }
}

export default Workshop
```

You will encounter a problem with missing depencency - just install the `bootstrap-css-only` package.

```
npm install --save bootstrap-css-only
```

Since Next.js doesn't support loading CSS files out of the box, 
we also need to modify the default Next.js config file a bit in order to be able to load CSS.

To achieve this, we need to install the package `@zeit/next-css`, 
which adds Webpack configuration for loading CSS files in the background: 

`npm install --save @zeit/next-css`

And then create a file called `next.config.js` in the root of our app and fill it with the following code:

```javascript
const withCSS = require('@zeit/next-css')

module.exports = withCSS({
  cssLoaderOptions: {
    url: false
  }
})
```

Now, we should be able to see our app in full color!
