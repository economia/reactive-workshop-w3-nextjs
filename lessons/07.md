## Let's start migrating!

First, let's create the file structure we're going to need: 
```
├── components
│   ├── Navigation.tsx
│   └── Preview.tsx
├── pages
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── article
│       ├── create.tsx
│       └── [id].tsx
```

Each file represents a router in our application, f.e. `pages/article/create` will be available 
at the route `/article/create`.

For now, you can just fill the files with empty wrappers: 
```typescript jsx 
const Page = () => ( <div/> )

export default Page 
```
