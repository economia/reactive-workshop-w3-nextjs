## Let's fill it up!

The last step to make our app fully functional (being able to create articles)
is to add the corresponding events for our forms!

Here is an example `submit` event for creating an article: 

```typescript
const formSubmit = async (event: any) => {
  event.preventDefault()

  const formData = new FormData(event.target as HTMLFormElement)

  const id = slugify(formData.get('title') as string)

  const article = Object.assign({
    id,
  }, Object.fromEntries(formData.entries()))

  await fetch('/api/articles', {
    method: 'PUT',
    body: JSON.stringify(article),
  })

  await Router.push(`/article/${id}`)
}
```

Notice the `Router.push()` call - using the `Router` object from `next/router` package 
allows us to programmatically change the location of our application!

*Note: since your app is being built dynamically thanks to HMR, after inserting your first article, the whole app will
be rebuilt in order to render the article detail page, which is going to clear the storage. After you insert the article
again, you will be able to see it in the app.*
