## Filesystem-based routing

By default, Next.js handles routing based on the filesystem structure: 
Every file in the `pages` directory translates to a route named the same as the file, 
i.e. file `home.tsx` will be available under `/home`.

Let's start by creating an example file in the `pages` directory: let's call it `articles.tsx`. 

```
└── pages
    └── articles.tsx
```

Every page must have a default export, otherwise Next won't be able to find which component to use.

An example file:
```typescript jsx
import React from 'react'

const Articles = () => (
  <h1>Hello there!</h1>
)

export default Articles
```

Now, if you navigate to the route `/articles`, you will be welcomed by the message you wrote.

Naturally, you might want to have a dynamic parameter in a route, so that you can f.e. serve many different articles.

This is very easy to achieve, just use `[]` around the param name, e.g. `[name].tsx` - this will provide you with a `name` parameter you can access from the component.

To access query parameters, simply use the `useRouter` hook from `next/router`.

Let's create another file, called `[id].tsx`, which will serve as a dynamic article renderer.

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

const Article = () => {
  const {
    query: {
      id
    } 
  } = useRouter()

  return (
    <h1>Showing article with ID { id }.</h1>
  )
}

export default Article
```

You can use as many params as you want, each one will be available to you in the `query` object.
